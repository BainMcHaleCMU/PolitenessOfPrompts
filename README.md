# PolitenessOfPrompts

A study of how the politeness of prompts affects performance of models.

To replicate the baselines from [How Well Can Language Models Understand Politeness?](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10195007), run evaluate_baselines.py

## experimentation

This folder contains .ipynb notebooks where we do initial testing and experimentation prior to condensing the work into .py files and modularizing everything.

## datasets

This folder contains modules for loading and processing the necessary datasets

## models

This folder contains the python modules corresponding to the 3 baselines evaluated
